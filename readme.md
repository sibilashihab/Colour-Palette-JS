<h1>About the project</h1>

A beginner project to get familiar with basic concepts in javascript. Followed along with the <strong><em>john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/01-color-flipper</em></strong> from freecodecamp.org.

<em>index.html</em> and <em>hex.html</em> are html files with basic html functions to create the page.

<em>index.html</em> along with <em>app.js</em> changes the background colour of the page to a random colour while <em>hex.html</em> and <em>hex.js</em> creates a colour palette of 6 colours.

<em>style.css</em> has been referenced from <strong><em>john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/01-color-flipper</em></strong> with few modifications.
